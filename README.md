A basic chatbot that gears towards certain topics. The purpose is to be able to traing a chatbot
in that it can talk like a normal person, but it has a specific mission in mind.

### The Goal
I'm looking to create a chatbot that stays on-topic.

Let's say the scenario is a date. A date is all about learning about each other (maybe), so
going on a tangent is not the best course of action at the dinner table. But also, you have
to keep the conversation interesting as to not seem boring. No one wants to seem boring --
at least try to be egotistical, I suppose -- so that the chances of finding that sweet
"click" just comes about. _I think._

### How to go about this
